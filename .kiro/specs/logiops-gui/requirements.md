# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern Linux GUI application for the logiops project (https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops). The logiops project provides a Linux daemon (logid) that allows users to configure advanced features for Logitech mice and keyboards. Currently, users must manually create and edit .cfg configuration files, which can be complex and error-prone. This GUI application will provide an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and managing these configuration files, making logiops accessible to users who prefer graphical interfaces over command-line configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Linux user with a Logitech device, I want a graphical interface to configure my device settings, so that I don't have to manually edit complex configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main window with device configuration options
2. WHEN a user selects a device configuration option THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate input fields and controls
3. WHEN a user makes configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the input in real-time
4. WHEN a user saves the configuration THEN the system SHALL generate a valid .cfg file compatible with logid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load and edit existing configuration files, so that I can modify my current setup without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Open Configuration" THEN the system SHALL display a file dialog to select .cfg files
2. WHEN a valid .cfg file is loaded THEN the system SHALL parse and populate the GUI with existing settings
3. IF an invalid or corrupted .cfg file is loaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
4. WHEN changes are made to a loaded configuration THEN the system SHALL indicate unsaved changes in the interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure device-specific settings like DPI, button mappings, and gestures, so that I can customize my device behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring DPI settings THEN the system SHALL provide numeric input fields with validation for reasonable DPI ranges
2. WHEN configuring button mappings THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown menus with available actions and key combinations
3. WHEN configuring gestures THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls for gesture direction and associated actions
4. WHEN configuring scroll wheel behavior THEN the system SHALL provide options for different scroll modes and sensitivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to validate my configuration before saving, so that I can avoid creating invalid configuration files that won't work with logid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to save a configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all settings against logiops configuration schema
2. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating what needs to be corrected
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL allow the save operation to proceed
4. WHEN saving is complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the file location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview the generated configuration file, so that I can understand what will be created before saving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Preview Configuration" THEN the system SHALL display the generated .cfg file content in a readable format
2. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for better readability
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
4. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy the configuration text to clipboard

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a modern, intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate and use all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface following Linux desktop guidelines
2. WHEN navigating between different configuration sections THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of the current section
3. WHEN hovering over configuration options THEN the system SHALL display helpful tooltips explaining each setting
4. WHEN the window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to install the GUI application easily on different Linux distributions, so that I can deploy it across multiple systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the application THEN the system SHALL provide installation packages for major Linux distributions
2. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL integrate with the desktop environment's application menu
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for logid daemon availability and display appropriate warnings if not found
4. WHEN configuration files are saved THEN the system SHALL save them to the appropriate system location for logid to find them
